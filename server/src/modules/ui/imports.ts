/**
 * UI Asset Imports (Placeholder)
 *
 * AUTO-GENERATED FILE - DO NOT EDIT
 *
 * This placeholder file exists so TypeScript compiles on fresh clone.
 * During `make build`, this file is overwritten with actual import
 * statements that embed UI assets into the compiled binary.
 *
 * How it works:
 * 1. `make build-ui` compiles the React app to server/public/
 * 2. `scripts/generate-ui-imports.ts` scans public/ and generates
 *    import statements with { type: 'file' } attribute
 * 3. `bun build --compile` embeds these files into the binary
 * 4. At runtime, files are accessible via Bun.embeddedFiles
 *
 * In development mode, this file is empty, and the server falls back
 * to serving files from the filesystem (server/public/).
 *
 * @see scripts/generate-ui-imports.ts - Generator script
 * @see modules/ui/embedded-assets.ts - Runtime asset lookup
